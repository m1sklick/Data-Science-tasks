# Data Science Tasks

These are the 3 different tasks which were given to me during my application process at eiGroup LLC in Baku, Azerbaijan.

I tried my best to comment everything so all the code becomes easier to read, but I will make this README file anyway, just in case.

These tasks were submitted on 4th of December and awaiting for response, but I promise to add README file here as well

## Installation

After you you git clone the project you should go and download the [Data Set](https://eigcom-my.sharepoint.com/personal/elnur_bakhtiiarov_researchlab_digital/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Felnur%5Fbakhtiiarov%5Fresearchlab%5Fdigital%2FDocuments%2FDesktop%2FMan%2FTasks%20for%20candidates%2FAI%20PTA%2Ffinal%2FSection%201%20and%203%20data%2Erar&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Felnur%5Fbakhtiiarov%5Fresearchlab%5Fdigital%2FDocuments%2FDesktop%2FMan%2FTasks%20for%20candidates%2FAI%20PTA%2Ffinal&ga=1) and then put these 2 files(Section 1.csv and Section 2.csv) into "data/" folder
